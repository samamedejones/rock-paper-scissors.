# Rock, Paper and Scissors game
![rps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01578706-cf61-4d6b-928e-0986dafb81be)


A game of rock paper and scissors to pass the time, with an interactive scoreboard and a minimalist but very beautiful interface!
## Aprendizados

In this project, the biggest learning was creating keyframes to make animations interactive with the game, and also using the setTimeout function to make everything more fluid and compatible.
