# Rock, Paper and Scissors game
![rps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01578706-cf61-4d6b-928e-0986dafb81be)


A game of rock paper and scissors to pass the time, with an interactive scoreboard and a minimalist but very beautiful interface!
## Aprendizados

In this project, the biggest learning was creating keyframes to make animations interactive with the game, and also using the setTimeout function to make everything more fluid and compatible.
Have fun
